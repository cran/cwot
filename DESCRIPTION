Description: A flexible and robust joint test of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) main effect and genotype-by-treatment interaction effect for continuous and binary endpoints. Two analytic procedures, Cauchy weighted joint test (CWOT) and adaptively weighted joint test (AWOT), are proposed to accurately calculate the joint test p-value. The proposed methods are evaluated through extensive simulations under various scenarios. The results show that the proposed AWOT and CWOT control type I error well and outperform existing methods in detecting the most interesting signal patterns in pharmacogenetics (PGx) association studies.
